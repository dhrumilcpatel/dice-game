# Dicee Game

A simple Dicee game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game allows two players to roll dice and determine a winner based on the higher dice roll.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Each player gets a turn to roll a dice.
- **Random Dice Roll**: The dice roll is randomly generated between 1 and 6.
- **Winner Display**: The game displays the winner with a flag icon, or declares a draw if both players roll the same number.
